# Mutant Standard's Cass Version

On [my website](https://github.com/DynTylluan/owly.fans), the primary set of emojis that I use are ones made by [Mutant Standard](https://mutant.tech) - I like them for the most part, I just wish they would follow Unicode, but they are still good for the most part. The emojis feature human skin colors, [such as this one](https://github.com/mutantstandard/build/blob/master/input/expressions/hands/hmn/wave%20%5Bhmn%5D.svg), but none of the emojis matched _my_ exact skin tone, so as the original project is open-source, I made my own. _Oh my!_

I also made other edits, mostly to the colors used on some emojis to better fit my own website.

There's nothing much to add to this, feel free to use these emojis under the same license as the one Mutant Standard picked and have fun.
